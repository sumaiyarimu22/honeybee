                                        Being a financial services consultant, I see myself being tasked with a big
                                        responsibility to
                                        educate and guide my clients through big financial decisions to achieve their
                                        goals in life.
                                        Through my work, the most rewarding and fulfilling experiences is being able to
                                        develop
                                        relationships with people from different walks of life and making significant
                                        impacts on
                                        their lives. ​
